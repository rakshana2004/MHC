            <h2>Why Setting Boundaries is Important</h2>
            <p>Healthy boundaries are essential for maintaining self-respect, emotional well-being, and strong relationships. Boundaries help protect your time, energy, and mental health while allowing you to communicate your needs effectively. Without them, you may feel overwhelmed, disrespected, or exhausted. By setting clear boundaries, you create a life that aligns with your values, reduces stress, and enhances personal growth.</p>

            <h2>How to Set Healthy Boundaries</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Your Limits:</strong> Reflect on what makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed in relationships, work, or daily life.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Use direct yet respectful language to express your needs. Example: "I can’t take on extra work right now, but I appreciate you thinking of me."</li>
                <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Practice setting minor boundaries first (e.g., turning off notifications during personal time) before tackling bigger challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Stick to your boundaries even if others push back. Consistency builds self-respect and trains others to respect your limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn to Say No Without Guilt:</strong> Saying “no” does not make you selfish; it protects your energy. You don’t owe an explanation for prioritizing yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Set Consequences:</strong> If someone repeatedly violates your boundaries, communicate the consequences firmly. Example: “If you continue to disrespect my time, I won’t be available for future projects.”</li>
                <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Surround yourself with people who respect your boundaries and encourage personal growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feeling Guilty:</strong> Remind yourself that setting boundaries is an act of self-care, not selfishness.</li>
                <li><strong>Fear of Rejection:</strong> Healthy relationships will respect your boundaries. If someone reacts negatively, it reflects their issues, not yours.</li>
                <li><strong>People-Pleasing Habits:</strong> Start prioritizing your well-being instead of trying to meet everyone’s expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Pushback from Others:</strong> Stay firm and repeat your boundaries calmly. Example: "I appreciate your perspective, but this is what’s best for me."</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
